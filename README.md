This portion of the TigerChow API handles all content related to reviews for the TigerChow app. The project was created and documented using Postman.

## Workflow
For this project, my team and I followed a Scrum workflow and utilized Kanban boards in Trello to complete each task during multiple one-week sprints.

## Status
This is an ongoing project, and I will continue to update this repository as needed.
